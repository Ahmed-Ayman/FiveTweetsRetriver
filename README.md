## about

Five tweets Retriever is a simple webpage that allows you get the latest five tweets according to some valid twitter User name.. currentyl its implemented completely in JS with the support of codebird-js library to authenticate with Twitter's REST api.

but soon I will do the complete web app using expressJS .. you can check out the json retriver above.

## installation Guide.

actually, all you need to do is downloading the repository .. you can do it by the following :

1. in the Command line type `git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Ayman/FiveTweetsRetriver.git`.
2. if the first way didnt work then you will have to download git from [from here](https://git-scm.com/), but don't worry for now ..you could just click the Clone or Download button above then download the Zip file.


## Usage.

open the index.html file in your browser then you will see a search icon..click it and type your twitter userName and  click Enter or Escape or on the Close button above right or by touching the screen anywhere.

now you are supposed to see the latest five tweets of the username or an error message says that the user isnt found or there's no tweets yet.

I have left my twitter api authentication cardentials just to make it easier for the code reviewer to check out my work... I will delete it after a couple of days though.
